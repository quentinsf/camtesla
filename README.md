# CamTesla

CamTesla is a thin Python wrapper around the Tesla API.  
It is so named because its originators, Quentin Stafford-Fraser and Simon Moore, live in Cambridge.

It's designed on the same lines as Quentin's [Qhue](https://github.com/quentinsf/qhue) wrapper for the Philips Hue API.

Until we get around to writing some documentation here, looking at that project will explain how it works.

You can see a simple example at the bottom of camtesla.py.  
If you run that file, giving it the email address and password of your Tesla account, it will find your car
and display some information about it.

But this isn't limited to vehicles.  You can use it for the Powerwall as well.
